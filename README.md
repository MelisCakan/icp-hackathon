Project details:
- 1v1 Card Game
A strategic 1v1 card game built on the Internet Computer using Motoko for the backend smart contract. Players battle using cards with healing and damaging powers, aiming to outlast their opponent!

Features
Strategic 1v1 card gameplay with random card draws.
Turn-based action with hidden card mechanics.
Motoko-powered backend smart contract for game logic.

Vision:
- Our vision is to create an engaging and strategic 1v1 card game that combines simplicity and depth, offering players a thrilling battle of wits and unpredictability. This game aims to provide a compact yet immersive experience where each decision matters, fostering strategic thinking and adaptability.

We envision this game as a platform for casual yet competitive gameplay, with a dynamic card pool that ensures replayability and keeps players coming back for more. The blind play mechanic emphasizes anticipation and psychological strategy, creating intense moments as players reveal their moves and calculate outcomes.

Our ultimate goal is to deliver a game that is easy to learn, fun to master, and can bring people together, whether for quick matches or extended play sessions. This project lays the groundwork for a scalable card game that can evolve with new mechanics, cards, and player interactions.
